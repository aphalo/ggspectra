ggspectra 0.1.1
===============

Add multiplot() function (unchanged from package photobiologygg).
Improve stat_waveband(). Add color_guide(), waveband_guide().

Add ggplot() methods for spectra, which use default mappings if mapping not
explicitly suplied as argument to call.

Make plot() methods almost fully functional. "contribution" and "participation"
summary values not yet implemented. Neither summaries for BSWFs. If requested
these summaries will show as "NaN" (not a number) in the plots.

ggspectra 0.1.0
===============

First preview version. Still with inconplete functionality.
