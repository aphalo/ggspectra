ggspectra 0.3.0 (2018-10-06)
============================

** Change the names of some the values calculated by the stats defined in
'ggspectra' to avoid confusion with the names of 'ggplot2' aesthetics.
** This is a code breaking change!

Revise to track changes in 'photobiology' version 0.9.24 and 'ggplot2' 3.0.0,
which are now required.

* stat_label_peaks() and stat_label_valleys() now have a new parameter,
label.fill which can be used to set the content of ..x.label.. and ..y.label..
for labels not labelled as peaks or valleys. The earlier use of "" is
retained as default.
* Add stat_find_wls() and stat_find_qtys(), two new statistics useful for
highlighting and labelling features in spectra.
* Add parameter ylim to all plot() methods.
* Revise plot() methods to support objects with multiple spectra in long form.
* Revise plot() methods to NOT display by default calculated summaries in
annotations when a plot contains multiple spectra.
* Revise plot() methods to retrieve and validate the name of the factor used
to identify multiple spectra, using as default the value stored in the attribute
"idfactor" implemented in 'photobiology' 0.9.21 and later.
* Add autoplot() as an alias of plot() for spectra and collections of spectra.

ggspectra 0.2.4 (2018-05-05)
============================

Revise to track changes in 'photobiology' 0.9.20 to avoid spurious messages.
* Add ggplot() method specialization for collections of spectra.
* Add plot() method specializations for collections of spectra.

ggspectra 0.2.3 (2017-12-18)
============================

Track changes in package 'photobiology' 0.9.18.
* Add plot.calibration_spct()
* Add ggplot.calibration_spct()

Improve handling of plot titles.
* Add utility function ggtitle_spct()
* Update all plot() methods to allow flexible contents in automatic titles including setting of the time zone and format used for displaying time.

ggspectra 0.2.2
===============

Track changes in package 'photobiology' 0.9.16 and 0.9.17. This among other
improvements makes it easy to plot spectral absorptance.
Expand y scale to expected range in all cases, but do not force these limits in
any case when data exceeds them, except for absorbance for which the y scale is
not expanded past 6 a.u.
Add new annotation "boundaries" to highlight with horizontal line(s) the
expected range of the plotted quantity, highlighting the limit(s) exceeded if
data fall outside the expected/range.
Add previously missing ggplot() method for class object_spct.
Revise vignettes.

ggspectra 0.2.1
===============

Track changes in package 'photobiology' 0.9.14.
Add continuous scales with defaults suitable for spectral data, with support
for automatic axis labels both as R-expressions and as LaTeX mark-up.
Add utility functions for SI scale prefixes.
Add utility functions for x-axis-labels and secondary x-axis.
Add utility functions for y-axis-labels.
Update User Guide (add examples of graphical comparison of multiple lists of
wavebands).

ggspectra 0.2.0
===============

Improve handling of annotations parameter in plot() methods.
Add functions ggcolorchart() and black_or_white().
Add statistics stat_wb_box() and stat_wb_column() with "rect" as default geom
and stat_wb_hbar() with "errorbarh" as default geom.
Change default geom from "rect" to "text" in all the summary stats for spectra.
Update stats with "text" as default geom to use an additional variable BW.color
computed by black_or_white() as default mapping for color.
As default geoms and color mapping have changed, this update can break existing
code. Changes to plot() methods are backwards compatible but default color of
some text labels is changed from "white" to "black" to improve readability,
and fewer peaks and valleys are highlighted by default. In addition more ticks
marks are used on the wavelength axis.
Fix minor bugs in handling of color mapping.
Update documentation.

ggspectra 0.1.12 (ver 0.1.11 was not submitted to CRAN)
================

Import ggplot2 in whole as only the most basic use of plot() methods would not
require user access to 'ggplot2'.
Add stat_label_peaks() and stat_label_valleys() which are designed to fully
take advantage of 'geom_text_repel()' and 'geom_label_repel()' as revised
in package 'ggrepel' (>= 0.6.3).
Change behaviour of plot() methods so that "illegal" values such as negative
spectral irradiances or transmittances are plotted by default.
Fix several minor bugs affecting plot() methods with certain non-default sets
of annotations.
Improve documentation and vignettes.

ggspectra 0.1.10
================

Add code to maintain same stacking order under ggplot2 1.1.0, 2.0.0, 2.1.0,
and 2.1.9000 in plot.object_spct().

ggspectra 0.1.9
===============

Add support for na.rm to all plot() methods setting default to TRUE, and avoid
triggering spurious warnings from internal code.
Make default for parameter 'label.qty' in plot methods dependent on whether
data are expressed in absolute units or have been rescaled or normalized.
Move from the 'User Guide' the sections on plot() methods creating a new
vignette titled 'Plot Methods'.

ggspectra 0.1.8
===============

Add support for plot.qty = "absorptance" to plot.filter_spct()
Add support for plot.qty to plot.object_spct() with possible values: "all" or
NULL (previous behaviour, and current default), "transmittance", "absorbance",
"absorptance", and "reflectance". The new options plot only one quantity at
a time as a line instead of the default area plot.

ggspectra 0.1.7
===============

Add stat_wb_label(), stat_wb_e_irrad(), stat_wb_q_irrad(), stat_wb_e_sirrad(),
and stat_wb_q_irrad().
Revise plot.raw_spct() to handle multiple "counts" columns.
Revise plot.cps_spct() to handle multiple "cps" columns.
Add text.size parameter to all plot() methods. Can be used to control the size
of the font used for text decorations related to wavebands, peaks and valleys.
Increase slightly the default font size for plot decorations, and decrease the
number of peaks and valleys labelled by the plot() methods.
Fix existing bug revealed by dplyr update.
Fix bug in decoration() affecting plot.objects_spct().
Fix other minor bugs.

ggspectra 0.1.6
===============

Clean documentation and code for CRAN submission.
Add examples of plotting of waveband objects as these were removed from
the vignette of package 'photobiologyWavebands'.

ggspectra 0.1.5
===============

Fix bug in documentation.

ggspectra 0.1.4
===============

Improve documentation.

ggspectra 0.1.3
===============

Remove wb_guide()
Remove wb_wb_summary()
Add stat_wb_mean(), stat_wb_total(), stat_wb_contribution(), stat_wb_relative()
Add stat_wb_irrad(), stat_wb_sirrad()

Implement 100% of the old functionality of the plot() methods, but without using
any annotations. In other words, now all calculations work as expected with
grouping and panels. Some aesthetics may require tweaking in the case of
grouping.

Tested with packages ggrepel and cowplot.

ggspectra 0.1.2
===============

Add text explaining examples to User Guide.

Rename several stats and functions with more descriptive names.

stat_color_guide() -> stat_wl_strip()
stat_average() -> stat_wl_summary()
stat_waveband() -> stat_wb_summary()
color_guide() -> wl_guide()
waveband_guide() -> wb_guide()

ggspectra 0.1.1
===============

Add multiplot() function (unchanged from package photobiologygg).
Improve stat_waveband(). Add color_guide(), waveband_guide().

Add ggplot() methods for spectra, which use default mappings if mapping not
explicitly supplied as argument to call.

Make plot() methods almost fully functional. "contribution" and "participation"
summary values not yet implemented. Neither summaries for BSWFs. If requested
these summaries will show as "NaN" (not a number) in the plots.

ggspectra 0.1.0
===============

First preview version. Still with incomplete functionality.
