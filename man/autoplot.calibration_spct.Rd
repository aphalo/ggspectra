\arguments{
\item{object}{a calibration_spct object or a calibration_mspct object.}

\item{...}{in the case of collections of spectra, additional arguments passed
to the plot methods for individual spectra, otherwise currently ignored.}

\item{w.band}{a single waveband object or a list of waveband objects.}

\item{range}{an R object on which range() returns a vector of length 2, with
min annd max wavelengths (nm).}

\item{unit.out}{character IGNORED.}

\item{pc.out}{logical, if TRUE use percents instead of fraction of one.}

\item{label.qty}{character string giving the type of summary quantity to use
for labels, one of "mean", "total", "contribution", and "relative".}

\item{span}{a peak is defined as an element in a sequence which is greater
than all other elements within a window of width span centered at that
element.}

\item{wls.target}{numeric vector indicating the spectral quantity values for
which wavelengths are to be searched and interpolated if need. The
\code{character} strings "half.maximum" and "half.range" are also accepted
as arguments. A list with \code{numeric} and/or \code{character} values is
also accepted.}

\item{annotations}{a character vector ("summaries" is ignored). For details
please see sections Plot Annotations and Title Annotations.}

\item{time.format}{character Format as accepted by
\code{\link[base]{strptime}}.}

\item{tz}{character Time zone to use for title and/or subtitle.}

\item{norm}{numeric normalization wavelength (nm) or character string "max"
for normalization at the wavelength of highest peak.}

\item{text.size}{numeric size of text in the plot decorations.}

\item{idfactor}{character Name of an index column in data holding a
\code{factor} with each spectrum in a long-form multispectrum object
corresponding to a distinct spectrum. If \code{idfactor=NULL} the name of
the factor is retrieved from metadata or if no metadata found, the default
"spct.idx" is tried. If \code{idfactor=NA} no aesthetic is mapped to the
spectra and the user needs to use 'ggplot2' functions to manually map an
aesthetic or use facets for the spectra.}

\item{facets}{logical or integer Indicating if facets are to be created for
the levels of \code{idfactor} when \code{spct} contain multiple spectra in
long form.}

\item{ylim}{numeric y axis limits,}

\item{object.label}{character The name of the object being plotted.}

\item{na.rm}{logical.}

\item{plot.data}{character Data to plot. Default is "as.is" plotting one line
per spectrum. When passing "mean", "median", "sum", "prod", var", "sd",
"se" as argument all the spectra must contain data at the same wavelength
values.}
}
\value{
a \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
These methods return a ggplot object with an annotated plot of a
calibration_spct object or of the spectra contained in a calibration_mspct
object.
}
\note{
Note that scales are expanded so as to make space for the annotations.
The object returned is a ggplot object, and can be further manipulated.
}
\section{Plot Annotations}{
 The recognized annotation names are: \code{"summaries"}, \code{"peaks"},
  \code{"peak.labels"}, \code{"valleys"}, \code{"valley.labels"},
  \code{"wls"}, \code{"wls.labels"}, \code{"colour.guide"},
  \code{"color.guide"}, \code{"boxes"}, \code{"segments"}, \code{"labels"}.
  In addition, \code{"+"} is interpreted as a request to add to the already
  present default annotations, \code{"-"} as request to remove annotations
  and \code{"="} or missing\code{"+"} and \code{"-"} as a request to reset
  annotations to those requested. If used, \code{"+"}, \code{"-"} or
  \code{"="} must be the first member of a character vector, and followed by
  one or more of the names given above. To simultaneously add and remove
  annotations one can pass a \code{list} containing \code{character} vectors
  each assembled as described. The vectors are applied in the order they
  appear in the list. To disable all annotations pass \code{""} or
  \code{c("=", "")} as argument. Adding a variation of an annotation already
  present, replaces the existing one automatically: e.g., adding
  \code{"peak.labels"} replaces\code{"peaks"} if present.
}

\section{Title Annotations}{
 metadata retrieved from object \code{object} is
  paased to \code{ggplot2::ggtitle()} as arguments for \code{title},
  \code{subtitle} and \code{caption}. The specification for the title is
  passed as argument to \code{annotations}, and consists in the keyword
  \code{title} with optional modifiers selecting the kind of metatdata to
  use, separated by colons. Up to three keywords separated by colons are
  accepted, and correspond to title, subtitle and caption. The recognized
  keywords are: \code{"objt"}, \code{"class"}, \code{"what"}, \code{"when"},
  \code{"where"}, \code{"how"}, \code{"inst.name"}, \code{"inst.sn"},
  \code{"comment"} and \code{"none"} are recognized as modifiers to
  \code{"title"}; \code{"none"} is a placeholder. Default is
  \code{"title:objt"} or no title depending on the context.
