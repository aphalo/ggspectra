\arguments{
\item{object}{a filter_spct object or a filter_mspct object.}

\item{...}{in the case of collections of spectra, additional arguments passed
to the plot methods for individual spectra, otherwise currently ignored.}

\item{w.band}{a single waveband object or a list of waveband objects.}

\item{range}{an R object on which \code{range()} returns a vector of length
2, with minimum and maximum wavelengths (nm).}

\item{norm}{numeric or character. Normalization to apply before plotting, If
\code{object} is already normalized, the normalization is updated when a
unit conversion applied.}

\item{plot.qty}{character string one of "transmittance" or "absorbance".}

\item{pc.out}{logical, if \code{TRUE} use percent instead of fraction of one
for normalized spectral data.}

\item{label.qty}{character string giving the type of summary quantity to use
for labels, one of \code{"mean"}, \code{"total"}, \code{"contribution"},
and \code{"relative"}.}

\item{span}{a peak is defined as an element in a sequence which is greater
than all other elements within a window of width span centred at that
element.}

\item{wls.target}{numeric vector indicating the spectral quantity values for
which wavelengths are to be searched and interpolated if need. The
\code{character} strings \code{"half.maximum"} and \code{"half.range"} are
also accepted as arguments. A list with \code{numeric} and/or
\code{character} values is also accepted.}

\item{annotations}{a character vector. For details please see sections Plot
\strong{Annotations} and \strong{Title Annotations}.}

\item{by.group}{logical flag If TRUE repeated identical annotation layers are
added for each group within a plot panel as needed for animation. If
\code{FALSE}, the default, single layers are added per panel.}

each spectrum when multiple spectra are included in a plot. It is used as
title to the guide in the plot and can include embedded spaces and new
lines.}

\item{facets}{logical or integer Indicating if facets are to be created for
the levels of \code{idfactor} when \code{spct} contain multiple spectra in
long form.}

\item{plot.data}{character Data to plot. Default is \code{"as.is"} plotting
one line per spectrum. When passing \code{"mean"}, \code{"median"},
\code{"sum"}, \code{"prod"}, \code{"var"}, \code{"sd"}, \code{"se"} as
argument all the spectra must contain data at the same wavelength values.}

\item{ylim}{numeric y axis limits,}

\item{object.label}{character The name of the object being plotted.}

\item{na.rm}{logical.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object with a number of layers that depends on the
  data and annotations. The \code{data} member retains its original class
  and metadata attributes.
}
\description{
These methods return a ggplot object of an annotated plot from spectral data
contained in a \code{filter_spct} or a \code{filter_mspct} object. Data can
be expressed as absorbance, absorptance or transmittance.
}
\details{
The plot object returned is a ggplot (an object of class
  \code{"gg"}) and it can be added to or modified as any other ggplot. The
  axis labels are encoded as \emph{plotmath} expressions as they contain
  superscripts and special characters. In 'ggplot2', plotmath expressions do
  not obey theme settings related to text fonts, except for \code{size}.

  Scale limits are expanded so as to make space for the annotations. If
  annotations are disabled, limits are not expanded unless
  \code{reserve.space} is passed to parameter \code{annotations}.

  The generic of the \code{\link[ggplot2]{autoplot}} method is defined in
  package 'ggplot2'. Package 'ggspectra' defines specializations for the
  different classes for storage of spectral data defined in package
  \code{\link[photobiology]{photobiology}}.

  For details about normalization and arguments to parameter \code{norm},
  please, see \code{\link[photobiology]{normalize}}. If \code{norm = NA},
  the default, \code{normalize()} is not called. All other values passed
  as argument to \code{norm} result in a call to \code{normalize()} with
  this value as its argument. In the case of objects
  created with 'photobiology' (<= 0.10.9) \code{norm = "undo"} is not
  supported. Be aware that calls to \code{normalize()} remove any scaling
  previously applied with \code{\link[photobiology]{fscale}} methods.

  For multiple spectra in long form spectral objects, with \code{idfactor
  = NULL}, the default, the name of the factor is retrieved from metadata. If
  the character string passed as argument to \code{idfactor} does not match
  the one retrieved from the object, results in renaming of the pre-existing
  factor. The default for collections of spectra is to create a factor named
  \code{"spct.idx"}, but if a different name is passed, it will be used
  instead.
}
\note{
The plotting of absorbance is an exception to scale limits as the
  \emph{y}-axis is not extended past 6 a.u. In the case of absorbance, values
  larger than 6 a.u. are rarely meaningful due to stray light during
  measurement. However, when transmittance values below the detection limit
  are rounded to zero, and later converted into absorbance, values Inf a.u.
  result, disrupting the plot. Scales are further expanded so as to make
  space for the annotations.

  If \code{idfactor = NULL}, the default for single spectra, the name of the
  factor is retrieved from metadata or if no metadata found, the default
  \code{"spct.idx"} is tried. The default for multiple spectra is to create a
  factor named \code{"spct.idx"}, but if a different name is passed, it will
  be used instead, possibly renaminig a pre-existing one.
}
\section{Plot Annotations}{
 The recognized annotation names are: \code{"summaries"}, \code{"peaks"},
  \code{"peak.labels"}, \code{"valleys"}, \code{"valley.labels"},
  \code{"wls"}, \code{"wls.labels"}, \code{"colour.guide"},
  \code{"color.guide"}, \code{"boxes"}, \code{"segments"}, \code{"labels"}.
  In addition, \code{"+"} is interpreted as a request to add to the already
  present default annotations, \code{"-"} as request to remove annotations
  and \code{"="} or missing\code{"+"} and \code{"-"} as a request to reset
  annotations to those requested. If used, \code{"+"}, \code{"-"} or
  \code{"="} must be the first member of a character vector, and followed by
  one or more of the names given above. To simultaneously add and remove
  annotations one can pass a \code{list} containing \code{character} vectors
  each assembled as described. The vectors are applied in the order they
  appear in the list. To disable all annotations pass \code{""} or
  \code{c("=", "")} as argument. Adding a variation of an annotation already
  present, replaces the existing one automatically: e.g., adding
  \code{"peak.labels"} replaces\code{"peaks"} if present.
}

\section{Title Annotations}{
 metadata retrieved from object \code{object} is
  paased to \code{ggplot2::ggtitle()} as arguments for \code{title},
  \code{subtitle} and \code{caption}. The specification for the title is
  passed as argument to \code{annotations}, and consists in the keyword
  \code{title} with optional modifiers selecting the kind of metatdata to
  use, separated by colons. Up to three keywords separated by colons are
  accepted, and correspond to title, subtitle and caption. The recognized
  keywords are: \code{"objt"}, \code{"class"}, \code{"what"}, \code{"when"},
  \code{"where"}, \code{"how"}, \code{"inst.name"}, \code{"inst.sn"},
  \code{"comment"} and \code{"none"} are recognized as modifiers to
  \code{"title"}; \code{"none"} is a placeholder. Default is
  \code{"title:objt"} or no title depending on the context.
